# WIP Analytics testing

Test scaffold for analytic plugins.

## Goals

1. Verify that plugins load the analytics provider library
2. Verify that `.page` calls map and call to the underlying window global
3. Verify that `.track` calls map and call to the underlying window global
3. Verify that `.identify` calls map and call to the underlying window global

## Example

For example, the `@analytics/google-analytics` plugin should load google analytics and track a page view

```js
import Analytics from 'analytics'
import googleAnalytics from '@analytics/google-analytics'

/* initialize analytics */
const analytics = Analytics({
  app: 'analytics-demo',
  plugins: [
    // ðŸ‘‡ this should load google analytics onto the page
    googleAnalytics({
      trackingId: 'UA-126647663-3'
    })
  ]
})

// ðŸ‘‡ this fire a page view to google analytics
analytics.page()
```

## Overview

- This repo is structured similar to how other "Monorepos" work.
- Each [`example project`](./examples) has it's own Cypress configuration, tests, backend and frontend assets.
- Each of these [`example projects`](./examples) share a single "root" Cypress that is installed in the root `node_modules` folder.
- This structure looks different from normal projects, but its the easiest way to manage multiple projects without installing Cypress independently for each one.

## Installation

```bash
## install all dependencies
npm install
```

## Opening Cypress GUI

```bash
cd ./examples/testing-dom__drag-drop
# start local server
npm start &
# and open Cypress GUI
npm run cypress:open
```

## Running from the CLI

Same as running Cypress GUI but with `cypress run` command (and any CLI arguments)

```bash
cd ./examples/testing-dom__drag-drop
# start local server
npm start &
# run Cypress tests headlessly
npm run cypress:run

### runs all example projects in specific browser
### similar to cypress run --browser <name>
npm run cypress:run -- --browser chrome

### sends test results, videos, screenshots
### to Cypress dashboard
npm run cypress:run -- --record
```

## Development
